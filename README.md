This project implements the framework needed to build a data drive simulator. 
It covers the following topics:
1. model.py builds a fully convolutional network (FCN) in TensorFlow using Keras
2. data.py demos generating random data and splitting into train and val dataset
3. generator.py in Keras to load and process a batch of data in memory
4. train.py trains the network
